# Age Estimation and Gender Classification CNN
 
Training CNN models to estimate a person's age and gender using face images.

**Tasks**

Training two CNN models:

- one is defined and trained from scratch
- the other is a pre-trained model that is fine-tuned

**Dataset**

The models will be trained and validated on a folder containing 5,000 labelled face images (size: 128 x 128), originating from the UTKFace dataset.

**Performance metric**

The metrics for measuring the performance on the test set are:

- age estimation: MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
- gender classification: accuracy
